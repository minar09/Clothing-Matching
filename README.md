# Clothing Matching & Alignment (2D)
A repository of tools implemented at SeoulTech Multimedia Computing Laboratory (EMCOM Lab, SeoulTech) for 2D clothing matching and alignment for 3D clothing reconstruction and virtual try-on.

## 1) Clothing texture alignment (Boundary extrapolation and matching)

### 1.1) Texture alignment using TPS transformation

### 1.2) Texture alignment using dilation operation

## 2) Interactive clothing to body alignment (Manual 2D matching)

Details: https://github.com/minar09/Clothing-Matching/blob/main/2.Interactive-Clothing-to-Body-Alignment/README.md



## 3) Clothing masking (Generating binary segmentation/silhouette)

### 3.1) Masking with GrabCut using priors

### 3.2) Masking with binary thresholding
